Elephants live in herds,
They eat small twigs, straw and wild fruits,
A pet elephant also eats bananas, bread and  sugarcanes,
Elephants are pure vegetarians. They are very useful for all,
They are used in falling trees, lifting logs, pushing them into rivers,
In olden time kings and dukes used to keep elephants for wars and battles,
In circus also elephants play very important roles,
